  description: "This is a first mod to add shooting weapons to the game: Slingshot, which can be crafted with \n \
3 sticks and 3 hypersilk, and deadly slingshot, which can be crafted with 3 deadly Bars and 3 hypersilk.
Hold right mouse button to draw a slingshot (which can be held both in main and offhand),\n \
and release to shoot.\n \
Shooting before the slingshot is completely drawn will deal less damage.\n \
Deadly slingshot is more accurate, shoots faster and farther. 
There are 4 types of bullets: Stone, Iron, Deadly and Solenoid, crafted out of their respective materials.\n \
Each of the first 3 bullets have more damage than the previous, Deadly bullet dealing the most damage.\n \
Solenoid bullet has less damage than Deadly, but it has a special property:\n \
it is attracted to nearby entities, including those that are outside your slice of the world.\n \
To change between types of bullets press R and F keys.
If two slingshots are held at the same time only the main hand one will shoot.
